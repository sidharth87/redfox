Steps to build redfox from the git repo:

acloal
autoconf
automake

stupid hack 1: for some reason my libprotobuf goes undetected in the previous steps, even though i have it in my ld path. I go around this issue by changing changing line 4097 and 4126 to LIBS="-L/home/collab/sidharth/TC/protobuf241/protobuf-2.4.1/build/lib64/ -lprotobuf  $LIBS"
basically add the absolute path for libprotobuffer.
I am sure there is a better way to do this but for now this works

./configure

stupid hack 2: for similar reasons as before, I have to add the include path for protobuf in the makefile. I edited line 180 of the makefile to DEFAULT_INCLUDES = -I/home/collab/sidharth/TC/protobuf241/protobuf-2.4.1/build/include/ -I.

make
